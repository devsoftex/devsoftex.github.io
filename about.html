    <h1 class="display-5 title">SoftEx Development previously known as OverClocked Studios.</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">SoftEx is a development studio that started out small in 2018. At the time we were known as Square Studios. We started on ROBLOX developing a "Roleplay" game. Similar games can be found all across ROBLOX. The game was know as "The Walls". It was meant to be a story based RP game. Eventually in 2019 we ended up scrapping the idea and moving on to an FPS. Around this time we also met an individual who will remain anonymous and we partnered with them. They helped a lot with the FPS System and GUIs. Eventually he told us that "Square Studios" was boring and this is when Exodus Entertainment was formed. It is now 2020 and we reamin as Exodus Entertainment. Next, we decided to merge our games into one. We got pretty large at around 800 members/supporters and we made a Hub. We went back to our own seperate games while keeping our merged game, this is when we formed our "ROBLOX Hub" where all three of our games we being kept and stored and worked on by all of us. Near after, our partners secrets started to get revealed and it heavily affected our reputation and we split ways taking our game with us and leaving the other two. It is now mid 2020 and we formed what is now known as OverClocked Studios. This is when we scrapped our FPS game and started working on what is now known as "Into The Wastelands" formely known as "Wastelanders". The game idea never changed and still to this day we are working on it. Skip to late 2020 and we want to expand OCS, we got into contact with some people who gave us the idea that we should make and launch a Steam game. This is when "Into The Wastelands" title was created. We planned to make the game on UE4 and we got some high-tier developers to start working. It is now 2021 and the game is getting into actual production. UE4 is being heavily worked on by me, BxnneddPancakes, as my team designs, creates and makes all our needed models. Around this time is when production halted. I lost my computer due to personal issues and OCS has been at a dormant state. I just recently reopened it but game production is still halted. Hopefully I am able to obtain my PC and get back at developing! Game release is now planned for December of 2022. On November 2, 2021 OverClocked Studios made their absolute biggest change yet. OCS moved from OverClocked Studios to SoftEx Development and all OCS Related servers were either deleted or moved to a "non-chat" server. SoftEx Development is now the home of CentOS Discord Bot and all OCS and Partners developer hub. Hope to see you around!</p>
